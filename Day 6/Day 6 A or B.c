**A or B**

There are two problems in a contest.

- Problem A is worth 500 points at the start of the contest.
- Problem B is worth 1000 points at the start of the contest.

Once the contest starts, after each minute:

- Maximum points of Problem A reduce by 2 points.
- Maximum points of Problem B reduce by 4 points.

It is known that Chef requires X minutes to solve Problem A correctly and Y minutes to solve Problem B correctly.

Find the maximum number of points Chef can score if he optimally decides the order of attempting both the problems.

---

**Input Format**

- The first line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers X and Y â€” the time required to solve Problems A and B in minutes, respectively.

**Output Format**
For each test case, output in a single line, the maximum number of points Chef can score if he optimally decides the order of attempting both the problems.
